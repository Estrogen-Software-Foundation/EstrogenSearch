# EstrogenSearch
Estrogen Search is a basic search engine made for fun without any tracking or nasty features that invade user privacy. 
Although it does not support many basic features, given enough time, it should be able to become somewhat usable. 
It should also be noted that the database is ***very*** large, and only a few hundred sites can cause the database to 
swell up to 100MB, so if you are planning to make it usable, either limit the crawler or have a very large disk + RAM

Requirments are beautifulsoup4, requests, along with flask. Requires Python 3.10+
To start the **main server**, run `main.py` and let it sit in the background
To start the **crawler**, run ./startcrawl.py. The program should give some basic information, such as # of sites crawler
and the URL of the crawled website.
